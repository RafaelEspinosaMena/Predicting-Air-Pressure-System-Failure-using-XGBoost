# Predicting Air Pressure System (APS) Failure Using XGBoost
This repository contains a detailed exploration and implementation of machine learning techniques in a data science context. The notebook begins with data loading and preprocessing, followed by an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) that includes visualization and statistical analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics.

The project then delves into feature selection and engineering, applying methods to enhance the dataset's suitability for machine learning models. Various models are constructed, trained, and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. The notebook emphasizes model evaluation, using metrics like ROC curves, AUC scores, and confusion matrices.

One of the highlights is the use of advanced techniques such as SMOTE for handling imbalanced datasets and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimizing model performance. The notebook concludes with a thorough analysis of results, demonstrating the application of machine learning in solving complex data-driven problems.

## Results

The models, in combination with the SMOTE class balancing procedure, achieved a final classification accuracy of 100%.
